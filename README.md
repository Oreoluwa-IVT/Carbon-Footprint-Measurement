# Carbon-Footprint-Measurement
Measuare how much carbon is emitted by an object, using a IoT Technology along with a few sensors.

### What is Climate !
Climate can be different for different seasons, Although we can defined climate as the usual weather of a place. It is normal to have diffent climates. Nevertheless, we have to know what is normal. You're probably thinking, how do we know if the Earth's climate is normal ? To answer this , we have to understand what Climate change is.

### Climate Change ?
Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. The changes can be experienced in a number of way. For instance ,the increase in the climate's temperature or 
sudden decrease in rainfall in a place are notable changes. What's more important, is how the changes in the earth's temeparature, affects how we live on it. 
The Earth's temeperature has increased by 1 degree celcius in recent years, and it has had striking effects. For instance the increase in temperature has caused Earth Ice to melt  causing see levels to rise. The effects are so much more !
Just imaging if the ocean levels rise so much , it starts to overflow ? yup ,very bad !

### What Causes Climate Change ?
Quite alot of things can cause the process of climate change. From volcanos errupting , to changing proximity of the sun to the earth and most importantly gases being emitteed into the atmosphere.

### How Can Help Solve Climate Change ?
When more and more gases are emitted into the atmosphere, it causes the air to heat up. which means, more Carbon Emissions , more hot air. 
Although, these aren't the only causes to the problem, but this is one way we can reduce the effect of climate change.
Using Carbon Emission Data in one square km, we could rougly estimate and develop useful solution for Carbon emission reduction. 

### This Project !
In this little repo ,we get to see how much carbon can be emitted by an Automobile using Carbondioxide Sensors. The data collected from this project
is used along with Total distance travalled 
and ambient temperature. Thereafter, we can analyze the data to make meaning out of it.







### Want to Help ? Get Started !
First, we need to purchase a few tools for our little project. 
An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an MQ9 Sensor and an MQ135 Sensor.
Once you have that, we'd need to install the Arduino IDE. 
Use the link below to install the Arduino IDE.
