# Carbon-Footprint-Measurement
Measuare how much carbon is emitted by a machine , Using a NodeMCU along with C02 sesnsors.

### What is Climate !
Climate can be different for different seasons, Although we can defined climate as the usual weather of a place.It is normal to have diffent climates ,nevertheless, we have to know what is normal ? To answer this , we have to understand what Climate change is.

### Climate Change ?
Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. The changes can be experienced in a number of way. For instance ,increase in the climate's temperature or 
sudden decrease in how much water or rain a certains geographical location gets. What's more important, is how the change in the earth temeparature affects how we live on it. 
The Earth's temeperature has increased by 1 degree celcius in recent years, and it has had striking effects. For instance the increase in temperature has caused Earth Ice to melt  causing see levels to rise. The effects are so much more !
Just imaging if the ocean levels rise so much , it starts to overflow ? yup ,very bad !

### What Causes Climate Change ?
Quite alot of things can cause the process of climate change. From volcanos errupting , to changing proximity of the sun to the earth and most importantly gases being emitteed into the atmosphere.

### How Can Help Solve Climate Change ?
When more and more gases are emitted into the atmosphere, it causes the air to heat up. which means, more Carbon Emissions , more hot air. 
Although, these aren't the only causes to the problem, but this is one way we can reduce the effect of climate change.
Using Carbon Emission Data in one square km, we could rougly estimate and develop useful solution for Carbon emission reduction. 

### This Project !
In this tinny , mini little repo , I get to read how much carbon is emitted by a Car, using Carbondioxide Sensors and that data is used along with distance travalled 
and ambient temperature ,then use that data to represent a fleet of cars in that came area. Thereby giving us a rough estimate of how much and how long climate can change.
